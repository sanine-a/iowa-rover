Iowa Science Rover - Rover Controller
=====================================

The main controller board for the SMM revision of the Iowa Science Rover.

The Metro Mini listens for commands from the kiosk via the radio transceiver, and then executes
the received commands via the motors. The switch allows the controller to choose which kiosk it
listens to, and the trimpot allows maintenance technicians to correct for any directional drift due
to motor wear over time.
